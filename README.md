# React Task List

You are looking at a small task list application that I made to practice my React skills. Give it a spin on the [live site](https://andreasremdt.github.io/react-task-list/).

## Features

* Add and delete as many tasks as you want.
* Tasks contain a title and date.
* Tasks are sorted by date and whether they are completed or not. Completed tasks are below, open tasks on top.
* Tasks are persisted in your browser using localStorage.
* Shows the number of open tasks

## Running locally

To run this application locally on your computer, run the following scripts:

```
// Install dependencies
npm install

// Start the development server
npm run start
```

You can now access the application on *localhost:3000*.

## Building

To make a production build, just run the following line:

```
npm run build
```
